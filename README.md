Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which each member of a development team integrates his work with that produced by others on a continuous basis.
With continuous integration, developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git. Prior to each commit, developers may choose to run local unit tests on their code as an extra verification layer before integrating. A continuous integration service automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately surface any errors.
According to the information I found, I would use Codeship or Travis (hosted or supported by Git Hub), however it seems that Jenkins is so flexible and popular also.
